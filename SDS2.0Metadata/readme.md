With a recent change to ths SDS2.0 platform, there were many additions to the metadata files. These included resources.xlsx which lists the tools important to replicating the research and code_parameters.xlsx which laid out measurable factors pertaining to the experiment. In our enhancement of SDS2.0, we have linked these two scripts together, making sure that the parameters important to an experiment are seen in tandem with the tools used to make them.

### Example

The frequency of a waveform is tied to the waveform generator used to produce it.
