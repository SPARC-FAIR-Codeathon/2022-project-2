## FAIR and SPARC mission
 Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR) are the key principles behind the data generated through SPARC funded projects. SPARC does an amazing job at standardising the way various datasets are presented on SPARC data portal. The datasets are hosted on the Pensive discover platform and are publically available. Hence datasets over multiple organs, species, and datatypes generated through research innitiatives across more than 50 institutes are curated and shared by SPARC offering better opportunities for multidesciplinary multi-institutional research initiatives. 

## Existing Opportunity 
   With such diversity in data generating sources, to meet FAIR standards, there's a need for a structured, standardised, informative and user friendly way of organising the raw data. SPARC portal is based on the metadata hosted on Pensive.io. The current form of the metadata includes the contributor information, study information, relational identifiers and participant information. This forms a rich source of information for any given dataset available on the SPARC portal. But this only provides an archivial ability to the SPARC portal. We realised that this could be changed to "life-cylce" monitoring of the dataset.
