## FAIR and SPARC mission
 Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR) are the key principles behind the data generated through SPARC funded projects. SPARC does an amazing job at standardising the way various datasets are presented on SPARC data portal. The datasets are hosted on the Pensive discover platform and are publically available. Hence datasets over multiple organs, species, and datatypes generated through research innitiatives across more than 50 institutes are curated and shared by SPARC offering better opportunities for multidesciplinary multi-institutional research initiatives. 

## Existing Opportunity 
   With such diversity in data generating sources, to meet FAIR standards, there's a need for a structured, standardised, informative and user friendly way of organising the raw data. SPARC portal is based on the metadata hosted on Pensive.io. The current form of the metadata includes the contributor information, study information, relational identifiers and participant information. This forms a rich source of information for any given dataset available on the SPARC portal. But this only provides an archivial ability to the SPARC portal. We realised that this could be changed to "life-cylce" monitoring of the dataset.
   
## Our Solution
As a contribution to the SPARC portal we argue that by simply tracking the activity and providing a paltform for discussion over a dataset would result in a healthy peer review system and cross communication among the researchers interested in using the datasets or protocoles present on the SPARC portal. By tracking the research articles that are using and citing the dataset and showcasing them on SPARC portal would have several benefits:
 1. Researches can quickly followup on findings and results presented in research papers utilising a dataset present on SPARC.
 2.  Interested researchers can quickly find the contributors (not only the contributors involved in the dataset creation but also those who provide further findings and results).
 3.  Encourages the multidesciplinary essence of the SPARC innitiative. For example if a neuroscientists sees an engineering research article citing the datatset at SPARC portal he/she/they may have new inspiration or interest in collaboration.
 4.  Advertises the research articles that uses dataset present on SPARC platform.
 5.   Discussions among the contributors and users of a dataset can lead to better understanding of the dataset and how to interact with the dataset.
