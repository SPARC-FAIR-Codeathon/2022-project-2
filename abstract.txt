Abstract:

SPARC's datasets are build to be FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable). This allows its users not only
to be able to consistently find the data that they need, but also to be able to automate processes that would otherwise
be impossible on another platform. This culture of consistency breeds community engagement, and this can be found in the 
large number of citations and references in and around the SPARC platform. However, the way that citations and references 
are handled on the SPARC platform as opposed to its metadata (which has recently seen a shift to the SDS2.0 configuration)
is lacking in accessibility. From Pensive to Google Scholar to protocols.io, there are many locations all housing citation
information for any specific study, and being able to automate this data in any meaningful way, or map the level of 
engagement that a single study has is difficult as a result of this. Our team envisions a "life-style" approach to the 
monitoring of citations and references in the SPARC platform, where each article can be tracked through its lifetime of
use by other researchers. By tracking the articles, we would see several benefits to the SPARC portal including: Encouraging 
the multidisciplinary essence of SPARC, cultivating discussion among contributes and users of a dataset, and researchers can
quickly find contributes that have provided further findings and results in this field.
