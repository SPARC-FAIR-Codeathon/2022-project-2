Abstract:

SPARC's datasets are build to be FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Resuable). This allows it's users not only
to be able to consistantly find the data that they need, but also to be able to automate processes that would othereise
be impossible on another platform. This culture of consistancy breeds community engagement, and this can be found in the 
large number of citations and referneces in and around the SPARC platform. However, the way that citations and referneces 
are handled on the SPARC platform as opposed to its metadata (which has recently seen a shift to the SDS2.0 configuration)
is lacking in accessibility. From Pensive to Google Scholar to protocols.io, there are many locations all housing citation
information for any specific study, and being able to automate this data in any meaningful way, or map the level of 
engagement that a single study has in difficul as a result of this. Our team envisions a "life-style" approach to the 
mionitoring of citations and refernecs in the SPARC platform, where each article can be tracked through its lifetime of
use by other researchers. By trakcinf the articles, we would see several benefits to the SPARC portal including: Encouraging 
the multidisiplinary essense of SPARC, cultivates discussion among contributers and users of a dataset, and researchers can
quickly find contributers that have provided furhter findings and results in this field.
